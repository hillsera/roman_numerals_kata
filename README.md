Trying to keep test driven development in mind was difficult for me in this assignment amongst other things. The idea of writing tests before actually writing the code is new to me and I imagine it’ll take some getting used to. My first instinct and what I usually do in my professional work is manually test as I write my code, which clearly won’t work in larger applications. I can see how the tests defined in the beginning can be a useful way of figuring out how to structure your code and kind of outlines a process you can follow to be sure you’re solving the right problems.

Another thing I realized outside of test driven development, is I need to increase my capabilities as a python developer. I used the internet and the Python Crash Course book to aid me in completing this assignment. For future assignments, I think if I adhere to TDD principles early on, it’ll help me gauge if I’m on the right track with my code or not. Perhaps I could start with smaller tests to ensure I have a solid foundation and then I could build up from there.
